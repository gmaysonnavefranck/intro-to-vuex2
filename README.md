# real-world-vue
  Project from VueMastery to learn Vuex. Here it is created a notification system using Vuex and some component communication to add and list user created events.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
I am using a json to simulate an API return, to serve that file run the following command:
json-server --watch db.json

After that simply run the project using: 
npm run serve
```

### Customize configuration
